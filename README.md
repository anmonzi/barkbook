## Background

Dog owners know the struggle. In a perfect world, their dog(s) would have other furry friends to play with, but the hassle of finding those playmates leaves us all just wandering to the dog park in hopes of finding that perfect playmate, and their (hopefully) cool human counterpart. With BarkBook, a user can search the Davidson County area by neighborhood and see a list of dogs in the area looking to make a furry connection. 
Each user can create a profile with a photo, a brief description of themselves, and choose the location that best matches their address. The user can then add their fur child(ren) and provide a photo, some information on size, age, energy level, and the dog’s behavior. Then the search begins!
Each location populates with dog cards that show a furry friend’s photo and gives a brief overview of their size and energy level. The user can click on a dog card to expand the information provided by their human and if it seems like a match, they can send a direct message to set up a playdate.
